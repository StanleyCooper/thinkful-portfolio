    <!-- About me section. Who am I? -->
    <section id="about-me">
      <!-- A paragraph or two about me. Include thinkful link -->
      <p>After graduating from high school, I decided to pursue a degree in project management and join my family's business in HVAC and Plumbing. During this time in High School, I was also taking coding classes such as visual basic, c++, javascript, and html.</p>
      <p> After graduating from college with my degree in Project Management and working as a lead installer and estimator for a few years, I found that I did not enjoy this career as much as I had thought. I wanted to switch careers to what I felt like I had a bigger passion for, which is why I have enrolled myself into the Engineering Flex program at <a href="thinkful.com">Thinkful.</a> I've been greatly enjoying my time learning and building up my skills so that one day, I can become a software developer.</p>
      <p>If you are looking for a new developer, or if you would like to connect for MeetUps, Hackathons, or anything of the sort, please reach out! I am excited to enter into this new field and begin building great things with others. </p>
